# Homework-Password-Generator
## Description
This homework assignment required us to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they’ve selected. This app runs in the browser using window prompts and updates the HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript to display a generated password that can be copied and pasted. 


We were given these accepence criteria:

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

  
- **What was your motivation?**
For this assignment, my motivation was to allow a user to create a secure, random password based on their selection criteria. 
  
- **Why did you build this project?**
We built this project to get more comfortable with Javascript logic as well as using it to change HTML and create a funtional tool.

- **What problem does it solve?**
This allows users to not have to come up with a random password on thier own or risk coming up with one on their own that might be easily guessable.

- **What did you learn?**
I learned how to use serveral javascript functions and variables together and how to use a computed value and place it into an HTML element.

- **What challenges did you encounter?**
I couldn't find a good solution for what to do if someone were to enter a letter or character other than a number in the first prompt.
