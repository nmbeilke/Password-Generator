# Homework-Password-Generator
## Description
This homework assignment required us to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app runs in the browser using window prompts and updates the HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript to display a generated password that can be copied and pasted. 


We were given these accepence criteria:

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

  
- **What was your motivation?**
For this assignment, my motivation was to allow a user to create a secure, random password based on their selection criteria. 
  
- **Why did you build this project?**
We built this project to get more comfortable with Javascript logic as well as using it to change HTML and create a funtional tool.

- **What problem does it solve?**
This allows users to not have to come up with a random password on thier own or risk coming up with one on their own that might be easily guessable.

- **What did you learn?**
I learned how to use serveral javascript functions and variables together and how to use a computed value and place it into an HTML element.

- **What challenges did you encounter?**
I couldn't find a good solution for what to do if someone were to enter a letter or character other than a number in the first prompt.
